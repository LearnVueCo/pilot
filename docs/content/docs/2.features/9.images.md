The `ImagesExtension` allows you to add images to your editor through either copy/paste or through drag and drop.

## Uploading Images

By default, images will be saved as base64 strings in the editor's JSON content. You can customize this to upload images to your backend instead.

Pass an `upload` function to the `ImagesExtension` that will send the base64 string to your backend and return the URL of the uploaded image.

```ts
async function uploadImage(base64: string) {
  const response = await $fetch('/api/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ base64 }),
  })
  return response.url
}

const editor = usePilot({
  extensions: [
    ...EditorExtensions({
      images: { uploadFn: uploadImage },
    }),
  ],
})
```

### Loading Styles

While an image is uploading, you can add an `imageLoadingClass` to add visual feedback. 

```ts
const editor = usePilot({
  extensions: [
    ...EditorExtensions({ 
      images: { 
        uploadFn: uploadImage,
        imageLoadingClass: 'opacity-30 animate-pulse' 
      } 
    }),
  ],
})
```
