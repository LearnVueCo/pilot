## Usage

The `Commands` component accepts a `commands` prop, which is an array of commands. And exposes a default slot that exposes the following properties:

- `editor`: the editor instance
- `commands`: the commands array
- `selectedIndex`: the index of the selected command
- `selectItem`: the function to select an item by index

Using these, you can create your custom UI for displaying your commands, selecting them, and changing the UI for the selected command.

## Commands Array

The `Commands` component accepts a `commands` prop, which is an array of commands.

Each command is an object that contains the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the command.
- `label`: The label of the command.
- `icon`: The icon of the command.
- `command`: The command to execute.
