subheading: 'Add code blocks to your editor with syntax highlighting'

Pilot uses [`tiptap-extension-code-block-shiki`](https://github.com/timomeh/tiptap-extension-code-block-shiki) to provide Shiki syntax highlighting for code blocks.

## Bundle Size

Code highlighting is performed by Shiki, which bundles all its supported languages and themes via lazy dynamic imports.

Most of the time, these files are only imported/downloaded when needed, but when you bundle Shiki, **all** files will be added, increasing your `dist` size.

Read more about [Shiki's bundle size](https://shiki.style/guide/bundles).

We are looking into ways to allow fine-grained bundling with Shiki, but this is not yet implemented.

## Troubleshooting

If tabs are not being rendered correctly, ensure that the `.tiptap pre` element has it's `whitespace` CSS property set to `pre`.

```css
/* CSS */
.tiptap pre {
  white-space: pre;
}

/* Tailwind CSS */
.tiptap pre {
  @apply whitespace-pre;
}
```
