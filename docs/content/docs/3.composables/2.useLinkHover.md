title: useLinkHover
subheading: Track the hover state of all links in the editor
---

Tracks the hover state all links in the editor. Can be combined with `<EditorTooltip>` to show a tooltip when hovering over a link.

## Usage

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const editor = useEditor(/* options */)
const { isHovered, reference, to } = useLinkHover(editor, {
  delay: 100,
})
</script>

<template>
  <EditorTooltip
    v-model:open="isHovered"
    :position="reference"
    :editor="editor"
  >
    <div>
      {{ to }}
    </div>
  </EditorTooltip>
</template>
```

## Options

### `delay`

The delay in milliseconds before the hover state is shown.

### `immediatelyClose`

By default, `useLinkHover` is not responsible for closing the hover state. This allows features like Tooltips, to be used in combination with `useLinkHover`.

If you want `isHovered` to be `false` immediately when the mouse is moved out of the hovered `a` element, you can set `immediatelyClose` to `true`. This means that if the hover state is used to show a tooltip, the tooltip cannot be interacted with.
