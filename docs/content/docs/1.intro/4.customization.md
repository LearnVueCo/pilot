Out of the box, Pilot gives you an unstyled editor. So to customize the look and feel of your editor, you can use CSS.

You can style your editor through CSS selectors or Tailwind typography.

## CSS

All of the elements in your elements can be targeted using CSS selectors. A `tiptap` class is applied to the root element of the `<Editor>` component.

```css
.tiptap {
  /* Your styles here */
}

.tiptap h1 {
  font-weight: 700;
  font-size: 2rem;
}
```

Check out the [Source Code]() for the demo app.

## Tailwind Typography

You can use Tailwind's Typography Plugin to style your editor by adding the `prose` class to your editor.

```vue
<template>
  <Editor class="prose" />
</template>
```

This will apply the default Tailwind typography styles to your editor.
