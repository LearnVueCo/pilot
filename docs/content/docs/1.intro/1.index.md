Pilot is a WYSIWYG Editor for Vue apps using Tiptap. It provides an opinionated set of core extensions that make it faster to build editors.

## Strong Defaults

Tiptap is a powerful and flexible editor, but there's a learning curve to building your own custom features with extensions.

Pilot simplifies the "nice-to-have" features that provide a better user experience. Features like link tooltips, image uploads, and fake highlights are all built in by default.

By providing these features out of the box, you can focus on building the app you want, not the editor.

## Customizable

Despite the opinionated defaults, Pilot is designed to be customizable. It's unstyled, so you can bring your own designs. It's extensible, so you can opt-out of the default features and add your own.

## Inspirations

Pilot was inspired by the following projects:
