Pilot is a WYSIWYG Editor for Vue apps built on top of [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/). It provides an opinionated set of core extensions that make it faster to build editors. 

## Built-in Features

Tiptap is a powerful and flexible editor, but there's a learning curve to building your own custom features with extensions.

Pilot simplifies the "nice-to-have" features that provide a better user experience. Features like link tooltips, image uploads, and fake highlights are all built in to the package.

By providing these features out of the box, you can focus on building the app you want, not the editor.

## Customizable

Despite the opinionated extensions, Pilot is designed to be customizable. By default, it only adds core extensions, although we recommend using the [Editor Bundle](/docs/features/extensions#editor-bundle) to get the most out of the package.

It's unstyled, so you can bring your own designs. It's extensible, so you can opt-in of the default features and add your own. 

## Inspirations

Pilot was inspired by the following projects:

- [tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/) - many of the core features are built on top of Tiptap's extensions
- [novel](https://novel.sh/) - Notion-like editor for React
- [Pilot G2 Pens](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Retractable-Premium-Roller-31020/dp/B001GAOTSW) - if the best physical writing experience is a Pilot, then the best digital writing experience should be Pilot too.
