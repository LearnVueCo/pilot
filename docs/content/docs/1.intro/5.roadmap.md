subheading: Pilot's future features

Pilot is meant to make it easier to build great editors, so any improvements to the core editor are welcome.

## Features I'm working on

1. Custom Components API

Integrating custom Vue components into a Tiptap editor is challenging. It requires custom node views, serialization/deserialization, and more. 

The Custom Components API will make it easier to use custom Vue components into a Pilot editor.
